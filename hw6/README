Exam 3 Instructions

I have three executables compiled in this directory for Linux, Mac and Windows.
Hopefully if all is well you should be able to run them directly in the terminal,
but if you are compliling it make sure to use the release flag, because that will
cut down the time it takes to run from 2 minutes to a few seconds.

Side note: I like to use colors when printing results out to the terminal since it
makes it a little easier to differentiate between stuff, but Windows doesn't like
that, so there might be weird characters littered everywhere instead of colors.
When I tested it in cmd it printed everything out okay, but if weird stuff happens
running it in Powershell should fix the problem.
